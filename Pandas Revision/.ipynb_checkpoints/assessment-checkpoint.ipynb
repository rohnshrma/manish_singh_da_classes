    "# Practical Data Analysis Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to reinforce Pandas concepts using the `coffee_shop_sales.csv` dataset, focusing on creating Series and DataFrames, indexing, reading CSV files, and basic data inspection as demonstrated in the provided code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- Use the `coffee_shop_sales.csv` dataset for all tasks.\n",
    "- Only use Pandas techniques shown in the provided code (e.g., Series, DataFrames, `loc`, `head`, `tail`, `info`, and setting display options).\n",
    "- Submit your code and answers as a Python script or Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Include clear comments explaining each step.\n",
    "- Ensure all outputs are displayed (e.g., print DataFrames, Series, or specific values).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Loading and Inspection\n",
    "- Load the `coffee_shop_sales.csv` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame named `coffee_df`.\n",
    "- Display the first 5 rows and the last 5 rows of the dataset using appropriate methods.\n",
    "- Print the structure of the dataset (e.g., column names, non-null counts, and data types).\n",
    "- Set Pandas to display all rows of the DataFrame when printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Creating a Series\n",
    "- Create a Pandas Series named `sales_series` from the `Total Sales` column of the `coffee_df` DataFrame.\n",
    "- Assign custom indices to `sales_series` using the `Transaction ID` column.\n",
    "- Print the entire `sales_series` and then print the `Total Sales` value for `Transaction ID` 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Creating a DataFrame with Custom Index\n",
    "- Create a new DataFrame named `coffee_subset` containing only the `Store Location`, `Total Sales`, and `Customer Satisfaction` columns from `coffee_df`.\n",
    "- Set the `Transaction Month` column as the index for `coffee_subset`.\n",
    "- Display the entire `coffee_subset` DataFrame.\n",
    "- Use indexing to print the row corresponding to the `Transaction Month` \"Jan\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Accessing Specific Rows\n",
    "- Using the `coffee_df` DataFrame, print the row with index 0 (first row) using numerical indexing.\n",
    "- Using the `coffee_subset` DataFrame from Task 3, print the `Customer Satisfaction` value for the row indexed by \"Apr\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Handling Missing Data\n",
    "- Identify which columns in `coffee_df` have missing values by inspecting the DataFrame's structure.\n",
    "- Print all rows where `Customer Satisfaction` is missing (manually inspect the output from `coffee_df` to identify these rows).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Creating a New DataFrame\n",
    "- Create a dictionary called `summary_dict` with two keys: `Store Location` (containing unique store locations from `coffee_df`) and `Average Sales` (containing the average `Total Sales` for each store location, calculated manually or using basic arithmetic).\n",
    "- Convert `summary_dict` into a DataFrame named `summary_df` with `Store Location` as the index.\n",
    "- Display the `summary_df` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- For Task 6, calculate averages manually (e.g., sum `Total Sales` for each store and divide by the number of transactions) since advanced methods like `groupby` were not shown.\n",
    "- Treat negative values in `Total Sales` or `Items Sold` as valid data unless instructed otherwise.\n",
    "- Ensure your code is executable and produces the expected output based on the `coffee_shop_sales.csv` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "- Submit a Python script or Jupyter notebook with the code for all tasks.\n",
    "- Include comments explaining each step.\n",
    "- Ensure outputs for each task are clearly displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Submission Structure\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task 1: Data Loading and Inspection\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "coffee_df = pd.read_csv(\"./coffee_shop_sales.csv\")\n",
    "# Display first 5 rows\n",
    "print(coffee_df.head())\n",
    "# Display last 5 rows\n",
    "print(coffee_df.tail())\n",
    "# Display structure\n",
    "print(coffee_df.info())\n",
    "# Set display option for all rows\n",
    "pd.options.display.max_rows = 9999\n",
    "print(coffee_df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task 2: Creating a Series\n",
    "# ... (continue for all tasks)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Criteria\n",
    "- **Correctness (60%)**: Code produces the correct output using only the techniques shown.\n",
    "- **Clarity (20%)**: Code is well-commented and easy to follow.\n",
    "- **Completeness (20%)**: All tasks are attempted, and outputs are displayed as requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck with your Pandas practice!"
